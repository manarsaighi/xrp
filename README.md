# Description of the project

This project is a simple VR experience based on the sustainable development goal "Life on Land". Pollination is crucial for life on the planet and bees are essential pollinators. Without bees, the world would suffer dramatically.

This project consists of a simple "pollination" interaction. The small flower field scene consists of 30 procedurally generated daisies and several bee models flying around. The pollination event is achieved through a click and is depicted using particle effects with a low gravity setting to simulate pollen scattering about.

# Description of the project

This project is a simple VR experience based on the sustainable development goal "Life on Land". Pollination is crucial for life on the planet and bees are essential pollinators. Without bees, the world would suffer dramatically.

This project consists of a simple "pollination" interaction. The small flower field scene consists of 30 procedurally generated daisies and several bee models flying around. The pollination event is achieved through a click and is depicted using particle effects with a low gravity setting to simulate pollen scattering about.

# Instructions for use

The experience consists of a single interaction. Users can move around the flower field and click on flowers to trigger a pollen particle effect.

# How it works:



# Code Snippets

![Bee Code](image.png)

The bee code uses cos(angle) and sin(angle) multiplied by different radii to create different sized oblongs for the bees to fly along.

![Flower Manager](image-2.png)

The flower manager is in charger of procedural generation of the flowers. From here you can control the amount og flowers spawned, how far apart they spawn from each other, and where they spawn on the y-axis.
